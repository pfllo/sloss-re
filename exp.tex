\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Experimental Settings}
\paragraph{Datasets}
Describe the two datasets.

\paragraph{Hyperparameters}
Describe the hyper parameters.

\subsection{Experimental Results}
We evaluate PR-curve (briefly introduce the PR-curve) for SL, base model, ILP, simplified SL.
\paragraph{Compare with Base Model}
Compare the semantic loss method and the base model (clear improvement).

\paragraph{Compare with ILP Method}
Compare the semantic loss method and ILP.

NOTE: clw also use cardinality constraints

\paragraph{Compare with Simplefied Semantic Loss}
Compare the semantic loss method and the simplified semantic loss.
Both on PR-curve, and on time.
