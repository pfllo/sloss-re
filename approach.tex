\section{Our Approach}
Briefly introduce the whole framework, and refer to each subsection one by one.

\subsection{Argument Type Constraints}
Describe clw's argument type constraints

\subsection{Semantic Loss}
Describe semantic loss, and how to encode clw's constraints into semantic loss.

\subsection{Incorporating  Type Constraints During Training}

\paragraph{Base Model}
Briefly introduce the base model (PCNN).

\paragraph{Training Procedure}
How do you construct the batches?
What is the loss function?
...

\paragraph{Simplified Semantic Loss}
Describe the simplified version of the semantic loss.
