	Identifying relations between entities is crutial for knowledge base population, question answering and etc.
	Most existing relation extractors make predictions purely based on the input natual language text, and ignores the argument type and cardinality constraints required by each relation.
	In this paper, we propose to format these constraints into boolean expressions, and incorporating them to existing relation extractors by introducing a new term to the original loss function.
	Our method do not introduces extra cost to the prediction phase and is plug-and-play for most existing relation extraction models.
	Experiments on both English and Chinese datasets show that our method improves the base model by a clear margin.
