\section{Conclusion}
%Describe contribution, experimental results (effectiveness of semantic loss method), possibly future work.
In this paper, we introduced a new loss term for \RE to help resolve the conflicts to type and cardinality constraints among local relation predictions, which is compatible to most existing relation extraction models.
Our method does not bring extra cost during prediction, and the experiments show that our method consistently improves the results of the base relation extractor by a clear margin. 
%and we get a clear improvements compared with the base model. 
%into the relation extractors through the semantic loss framework to help resolve the disagreements among local relation predictions, and we get a clear improvements compared with the base model. 
%Our method automatically learns the constraints during training, and does not incurs extra costs in testing. 
%Further, our method prefers to get high-confidence extraction results comparing with \ILP, this is crucial in practice.
%And our method could generally incorporate with most relation extractor models and help them to resolve the disagreements among local relation predictions.
